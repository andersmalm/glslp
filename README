GLSLP ( OpenGL Shader Helper )

What?
This is a small tool for converting .glsl files into a .cpp and a .h file which can be included and used in your projects.
It removes unnecessary whitespaces and strips out the comments.

How?
If you have the binary, just run "glslp.exe -dir <dir with shaders>"

Each shader will be a const char* named after file name in the shader namespace.
example : foobar.glsl will become const char* shader::foobar_glsl

In the folder with the shaders two new files will be generated, shaders.cpp and shaders.h.
Just build one and include the other.. and you will have a most excellent day coding!

Disclaimer:
I have tried it on a lot of my own shaders without any problems, but I can't promise it will work everywhere.
